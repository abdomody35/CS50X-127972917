# Harvard CS50X: CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

## Overview
This repository contains all the projects I completed during the Harvard CS50X course.

### Week 0: Scratch

**Scratch:**
- Implement in Scratch, at [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu), any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:
  - Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat. 
  - Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
  - Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
  - Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
  - Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than [Oscartime](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196) and [Ivy’s Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433). <br><br> To meet these requirements, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall. And your code should ideally be not only correct but also well-designed. If one of your scripts is getting a bit long, try to break it up into multiple scripts (each of which does something specific). And try to leverage “abstraction” where possible: if you can imagine giving a descriptive name to a sequence of blocks (e.g., meow), those could probably be moved to a custom block!

### Week 1 C

1. **Hello, It’s Me:**
   - In a file called `hello.c`, in a folder called `me`, implement a program in C that prompts the user for their name and then says hello to that user. For instance, if the user’s name is Adele, your program should print `hello, Adele\n`!

2. **Mario (less-comfortable):**
   - In a file called `mario.c` in a folder called `mario-less`, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:
     ```
            #
           ##
          ###
         ####
        #####
       ######
      #######
     ########
     ```
   - But prompt the user for an int for the pyramid’s actual height, so that the program can also output shorter pyramids like the below:
     ```
       #
      ##
     ###
     ```
   - Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than 0 or not an int altogether.

3. **Mario (more-comfortable):**
   - In a file called `mario.c` in a folder called `mario-more`, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:
     ```
        #  #
       ##  ##
      ###  ###
     ####  ####
     ```
   - And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive int between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

4. **Cash:**
   - In a file called `cash.c` in a folder called `cash`, implement a program in C that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents.
   - But prompt the user for an int greater than 0, so that the program works for any amount of change.
   - Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than or equal to 0 (or if their input isn’t an `int` at all!).

5. **Credit:**
   - In a file called `credit.c` in a folder called `credit`, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number.
