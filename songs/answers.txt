SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

Well, There are many ways this could be wrong. Maybe someone else was using his account like his
girlfriend or one of his family members or he could have used it alot to listen to songs while
in the car with his friends so it is not always his choice of music which could lead to a non-exact
reading of his aura. Let's suposse that - for the sake of this question - that it was his choice of
music, it wasn't influenced by anyone and no one else was using his account. Songs are not only energy,
valence and danceability - despite being  the most important when it comes to calaulating tha audio
aura-, They have many more characteristics that cannot be simply ommited because they are less important.
What they should do is analayize the data in a better way, maybe like try and find a formula that using
all the characteristics of the top 100 songs - each multiplied by a factor based on the importance -
would give a better so called "reading" of that audio aura of that person.
